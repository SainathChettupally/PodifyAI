Given a set of data points, partition them into groups (i.e., clusters) which are as similar as possible as possible . Cluster analysis is unsupervised learning (i., no predefined classes) Typical ways to use/apply cluster analysis: As a stand-alone tool to get insight into data distribution, or as a preprocessing (or intermediate) step for other algorithms . Outlier detection: Outliers—those “far away” from any cluster . Clustering space: Full space (often when low dimensional) vs. subspaces (often in high-dimensional clustering) Scalability, ability to deal with different types of attributes .
